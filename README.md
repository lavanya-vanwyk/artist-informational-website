# Artist Informational Website

This website is a small informational website I built to be responsive using pure HTML & CSS,  without Bootstrap!


## Project goals and features

The aim of this project was to build a beautiful landing page for one of my favourite visual artists. Styled dynamically and responsively using CSS Grids. I wanted to find a way to incorporate an HTML table without just coding a bland info table with just data. While not common practice, I used it as a scrollable "gallery" of images
The challenge with these tables is making them responsive, however using a little overflow hack and limiting the size of the container, one is able to! This was very fun to build and I am happy with how sleek it came out.
