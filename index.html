            <h3>about the artist</h3>
            <p>
              Mary Sibande (b. 1982, Barberton, South Africa) is a
              multidisciplinary artist renowned for her compelling explorations
              of identity, the black female body, and the socio-political
              landscape of post-colonial and post apartheid South Africa. She
              received her Diploma in Fine Arts from the Witwaterand Technical
              College and her Honours degree from the University of Johannesburg
              in 2007.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Sibande's practice combines sculpture, photography, and
              installation, often centered around her alter-ego, Sophie. This
              sculptural figure, modeled after herself and inspired by the women
              in her family, serves as a powerful symbol of femininity, labour,
              and the intersection of personal and collective histories.
