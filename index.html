            <h3>about the artist</h3>
            <p>
              Mary Sibande (b. 1982, Barberton, South Africa) is a
              multidisciplinary artist renowned for her compelling explorations
              of identity, the black female body, and the socio-political
              landscape of post-colonial and post apartheid South Africa. She
              received her Diploma in Fine Arts from the Witwaterand Technical
              College and her Honours degree from the University of Johannesburg
              in 2007.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Sibande's practice combines sculpture, photography, and
              installation, often centered around her alter-ego, Sophie. This
              sculptural figure, modeled after herself and inspired by the women
              in her family, serves as a powerful symbol of femininity, labour,
              and the intersection of personal and collective histories.

                  This exhibition focused on reflecting on how a complicated
                  history is not to be repeated in the future. Historical
                  artifacts from the Indiana Historical Society, the Indiana

                  Displayed until May 21, 2022, artist Mary Sibande's solo
                  exhibition in Cape Town explores these captives of the present
                  times, agitated. They know that this obvious indiscretion
                  alone can lead them away from the abuses of colonization, as
                  another type of relationship is established.
